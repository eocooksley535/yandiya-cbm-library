## Ideas

Brainstorm of additional developemnt ideas - 1 June 2022

- All programs that interact with libaray should work regardless of
  how the libaray now stores the data (CLI, GUI, WebUI)
- version of the library that stores the data in a database file (SQL) instead
- if the library is SQL based it should have additional features such as:
  - export database as excel function
